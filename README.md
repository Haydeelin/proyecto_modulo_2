-If the word length is in the range of four to eight letters a message should be printed stating that the word is correct

-If the word has less than 4 letters you must indicate a message that says: Letters are needed. It has only N letters (where N is the number of letters in the word)

-If the word has more than 8 letters you must indicate a message that says: There are too many letters. It has N letters (where N is the number of letters in the word)
